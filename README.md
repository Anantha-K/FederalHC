## FISAT HORIZON CLUB

This is the official website for FISAT HORIZON CLUB, developed and maintained by me. The site is designed to provide training and resources in web development, VR app development, game development, and more.




## About the Project

I created this website to support the organization’s mission of offering top-tier training in various tech domains. The site showcases a modern, interactive design that leverages the latest web technologies.



## Tech Stack

The website is built using a range of powerful tools and frameworks:

	•	Next.js 14: Utilized for server-side rendering, static site generation, and advanced routing.
	•	GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Enables high-performance, professional-grade animations.
	•	Framer Motion: Used for smooth and responsive animations throughout the site.
	•	Three.js: A 3D library that brings immersive experiences to the web.
	•	React Three Fiber: A React wrapper for Three.js, making it easier to create 3D content.
	•	Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that ensures a responsive and visually appealing design.


## Installation and Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
